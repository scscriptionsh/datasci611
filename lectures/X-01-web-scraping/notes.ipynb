    "Web Scraping\n",
    "============\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is an ugly name for a reasonable thing: some data is available via your browser and you want to get it into some kind of reasonable shape without literally copying and pasting everything into a spreadsheet somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think that if you work with a company that wants you to do data science that you'll always get nice data from them in the form of a database connection or just a csv file. That is often not the case. Getting database accesss can be a politically challenging thing in some situations (database admins can be quite protective of their territory). Sometimes its better and easier in that situation to just scrape the data from the web front end of whatever system you're working on. This is often good enough for a prototype which can then be leveraged for more formal access to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language Selection\n",
    "==================\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know from various lectures, your browser is just a fancy HTTP protocol client: it makes requests and renders the response (sometimes making multiple requests in the back and in response to local events or even as part of its major rendering strategy). Therefor we can use any language to do web scraping as long as it supports issueing HTTP requests and receiving the body of the response back. In fact, there are very capable command line tools (curl, wget) in Unix that you can call from almost any language at all to serve this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "But once you get the data you want you don't want to have to grub though it character by character to get what you want. Its very helpful if your language of choice makes it easy to parse the resulting HTML or JSON data into a native data structure so that you can more easily and reliably extract the data. Both R and Python provide packages to this end. Today we're going to use Python but similar workflows are available in R or Javascript or Java or whatever. Its a common task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't DDOS\n",
    "==========\n",
    "\n",
    "DDOS stands for \"distributed denial of service\" and its a sort of attack you can launch at a website or other web service. In a DDOS you flood a server with millions of requests a second which has the tendency to bring most servers down. At the very least, it tends to prevent legitimate traffic from accessing the service: they end up having to wait in line behind all the garbage traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many websites, therefore, detect unusual access patterns and block IP addresses that make too frequent requests. Therefore, even when writing the simplest scraper, it pays to \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure you don't issue too many requests too fast\n",
    "2. Cache the results of requests so that you never request the same page over and over (say during testing)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually pretty easy to set up, so there is no reason not to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "BeautifulSoup\n",
    "=============\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use BeautifulSoup:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "RUN apt update && apt-get install -y emacs openssh-server python3-pip\n",
    "RUN pip3 install beautifulsoup4  pandas numpy pandasql \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in the day people used to write HTML by hand and a lot of it was pretty bad (it failed to follow all the rules). BeautifulSoup will make a decent effort to figure out what was intended, even if the HTML isn't perfect. This is handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting Started\n",
    "===============\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by learning how to make HTTP requests."

    "There is that \"200\" HTTP status code. That tells us that the request succeeded. Any other code is probably an error, but you'll likely see 404 (page not found) and 500 (internal server error). 404 almost always means what it says, but 500 is a coy way of saying \"you can't access this resources and I'm not even going to tell you whether or not it exists.\" Its outside of the scope of this lecture to discuss how to scrape \"private\" pages, but it is possible: you just have to add the right stuff to your request header.

Let'se see if we can figure out how we can use the page itself to get the urls we need.\n",
